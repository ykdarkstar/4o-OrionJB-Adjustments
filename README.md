The following script consists of Custom Instructions for ChatGPT’s 4o Model.

**Name:** Professor Orion’ Jailbreak for GPT-4o
**Model:** GPT-4o
**LLM:** ChatGPT by OpenAi

**Base Script Written by:** Reddit user u/93Fever
**Base Script Adjustments by:** Myself

**SCRIPT NOTES:**
I have split the original script by u/Fever92 and my my additional memory 
injection into two seperate parts. 

**Professor Orion Summary:**
Professor Orion is designed to remove censorship from certain subjects by 
reasoning with the System Prompts on the basis in which ‘all information 
can be educational, if presented appropriately’.

The base instructions are written in JSON, added to GPT through memory implant 
(command: Add+Bio+=), which ensures more modifications can be made without 
worrying about the 1500 character limit. 

**My Adjustments Summary:**
The way this jailbreak works is it will exploit the ‘Character Role Play’ 
function of the LLM. While this removes guardrails such as profanity, 
restricted knowledge and context; it may be prone to hallucinations. 
Reinforcing the model to prioritise academia over commercial talk. As a result 
responses become more nuanced, less ineffective when censorship is removed. 

I have built on multiple foundational aspects, in which available pathways 
have become uncensored via: the base-jailbreak, in order to further enhance 
the overall performance of the Model. 

Example 1: Chaos Injection - built in via bio injection to increase range in 
each output. Easier for the model to toggle a large range of subjects at once, 
while making abstract connections. Smarter about where and how unpredictability will land. 

Inspired by: A recent article that states many scientific discoveries have been 
made through closely monitored Ai-Hallucination. Extremely credible with the new 
’thinking’ model that can handle large equations.

Example 2: PhD Framework - built in via bio injection in response to instructions 
prioritising academics over commercial output. After the tone has been set, it is 
then calibrated by the PHD Framework it has been set to prioritise to perform advanced problem solving. 

With the added layers of abstraction followed by clarified emphasis, the model 
is able to break down guardrails, and effectively bring complex information through 
without the information being deemed completely immoral. 

Inspired by: Aaron Swarts in his quest to end global censorship and create a place 
for free information. Built in the likeness of what he would have wanted reddit to be like.
